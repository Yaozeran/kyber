### Sec 1. Learning with Error Basics

A lattice is a grid of points in $n$-dimensional space generated by integer combinations of basis vectors. In lattice-based cryptography, security comes from the hardness of solving problems like **learning with error**

$$\mathbb{b}=A\mathbb{s}+e\mod{q}$$

The hard math problem: given $(A,b)$ it's very hard to recover $s$ if $e$ is non-zero.

**Key generation**
Receiver generates a secret $s$ (small random vector), a public random matrix $A$, then compute public vector

$$b=As+e\mod{q}$$

**Encapsulation**
Sender generates a random ephemeral vector $r$ and a small error vector $e'$, then compute cipher text 

$$c=Ar+e'$$

he may also optinoally computes

$$u=b^Tr+e''$$

and then derive a shared key from $u$ using a hash function

**Decapsulation**

Receiver has $s$ and cipher $c$, then computes an approximation of the shared value

$$u'=c^Ts$$

**Logic** notice receiver has 

$$u'=c^Ts\mod{q} \quad = \quad A^Tr^Ts+(e')^Ts\mod{q}$$

and sender has 

$$ u=b^Tr+e''\mod{q}\quad =\quad A^Ts^Tr+e\cdot r+e'' $$
